1. Why I Chose Python and Flask
I used Python and Flask because they're tools I know well. Flask makes creating a web API super easy, and 
Python has great libraries that help me work with dates and data quickly. This meant I could build the project faster and with fewer headaches.

2. Pros and Cons of My API
Pros:

- The code is straightforward and easy to read
- Storing data in the computer's memory makes the app run quickly
- Simple to understand how the points system works

Cons:

- All the data gets erased if the server restarts
- If there were millions of transactions, the app might slow down or use too much computer memory
- The error checking could be improved to make the app more reliable in a real-world situation

3. My Favorite Project

One of the coolest projects I've worked on is the Saveory app. While building the app was exciting, the biggest challenge was creating a reliable and real-time data system for local business deals.
The most difficult technical hurdle was designing a backend that could handle dynamic updates from multiple businesses in real-time. We needed a system where restaurants and bars could quickly update their deals, and users would see those changes instantly. 
This required me to learn complex state management techniques and implement efficient data streaming using Firebase.

I had to solve several intricate problems:

- Creating a secure authentication system that verified business owners and users
- Developing a solid caching system to keep the app responsive
- Implementing geolocation features to show live nearby deals accurately
- Designing an clean interface that could handle data changes instantly

The biggest personal challenge was coordinating with local businesses to onboard them onto my app. Many small business owners were hesitant about using a new technology, so I had to convince them of the app's value and build trust.
This project pushed me out of my comfort zone technically and professionally. I learned that building a successful app isn't just about writing codeâ€”it's about solving real-world problems and creating value for both businesses and users.
